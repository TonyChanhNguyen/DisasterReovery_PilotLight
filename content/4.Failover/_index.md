In the event a disaster affects your primary region N. Virginia (us-east-1), you want to bring up the resources in the secondary region N. California (us-west-1).

### Simulating a Regional Service Event

You will now simulate a regional service event affecting the Unishop website in N. Virginia (us-east-1). You are going to achieve this by blocking public access to the S3 bucket that is hosting the website making the Unishop website unavailable.

1. Go to [S3](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home).
2. Click on the bucket name **pilot-primary-uibucket-xxxxxxxxxxxx**.
